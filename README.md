# LLM Development Guidelines

A comprehensive collection of rules, best practices, and guidelines for working with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and other LLM-powered development tools.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized resource for:

- **Development Rules**: Tool-agnostic and tool-specific rules for AI-assisted coding
- **Best Practices**: Proven strategies for working effectively with LLM coding assistants
- **Examples & Templates**: Practical demonstrations and reusable resources
- **Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for common scenarios

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Rules**: Start with the `rules/general/` folder for foundational principles
2. **Tool-Specific**: Check the tool-specific folders for your primary AI coding tool
3. **Examples**: Review examples to see rules in action
4. **Templates**: Use templates as starting points for your own workflows

## Contributing

This is a personal repository for documenting and refining my own AI coding practices. Feel free to fork and adapt for your own use.
